\maketitle

This document is a template for you to take notes in my MATH 3142 course.
For your note check grade, you are required to complete all proofs/solutions
for the problems specified. This template will be updated periodically
throughout the course; you are responsible for updating your copy
as the template is updated. See the syllabus for more details.

You should maintain your notes on Overleaf.com and provide me with a
link so I can check on them. I'll give you notice before notes are ``due'';
when they are due I will download a copy myself from Overleaf.

This is not a replacement for the textbook for this course,
\textit{Advanced Calculus} by Patrick M. Fitzpatrick. Many proofs are
outlined in that text, as well as all the relevant definitions and other
results not included in these notes.

A proof is valid if and only if it uses concepts proven previously in
the book. For example, you cannot prove a lemma in Chapter 6 using
a theorem from Chapter 10, but using a proposition from Chapter 4
is allowed.

I hope you enjoy working through these results. Please email me with
any questions.

  \(x\geq 0\), then
  \[
    \int_0^x g\leq \int_0^x h
    \text{~~ for all~} x\geq 0
  .\]
  Use this and the First Fundamental Theorem to show that each of the following
  inequalities implies the next:
  \[

  .\]
  \[
    x-\frac{x^3}{6} \leq \sin x \leq x
    \text{~~ if~} x\geq 0

  are differentiable functions with the properties
  \(\sin(0)=0\), \(\cos(0)=1\), \(\frac{d}{dx}[\sin(x)]=\cos(x)\),

\chapter{Metric Spaces}

\begin{definition}

  and \(d\) is a function \(d:X^2\to[0,\infty)\) satisfying the following
  properties:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Identity: \(d(p,q)=0\) if and only if \(p=q\).
    \item Symmetry: \(d(p,q)=d(q,p)\).
    \item Triangle Inequality: \(d(p,q)\leq d(p,w)+d(w,q)\).
  \end{itemize}

\begin{definition}
  Let \((X,d)\) be a metric space. For \(p\in X,r>0\),
    \[ B_r(p)=\{q\in X:d(p,q)<r\} \]
  is the open ball about \(p\) with radius \(r\). For \(A\subseteq X\),
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \(\interior A = \{q\in A:\exists r>0(B_r(q)\subseteq A)\}\)

  \]
  in the case that whenever \(\{\vect x_k\}\) is a sequence of points in

  then \(\{f(\vect x_k)\}\) is a sequence of real numbers which
  converges to \(L\).

\section{The Mean Value Theorem and Directional Derivatives}

\begin{lemma}[13.14, The Mean Value Lemma]
  Let \(U\subseteq\mb R^n\) be open and \(1\leq i\leq n\). Let
  \(f:U\to\mb R\) be a function with a partial derivative with respect to its
  \(i\)th component at each point in \(U\). Let \(\vect x\in U\) and
  \(a\in\mb R\) such that \(\vect x+\theta a\vect e_i\in U\) for all
  \(\theta\in[0,1]\). Then there is some \(\theta\in(0,1)\) such that
  \[
    f(\vect x+a\vect e_i)
      -
    f(\vect x)
      =
    a\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(\vect x+\theta a\vect e_i)

\begin{proposition}[13.15, The Mean Value Proposition]
  Let \(\vect x\in\mb R^n\) and \(r>0\). Let \(f:B_r(\vect x)\to\mb R\)
  be a function with first-order partial derivatives. Then if
  \(\vect h\in\mb R^n\) satisfies \(\|\vect h\|<r\), then
  there are points \(\vect z_i\in B_{\|\vect h\|}(\vect x)\) for
  \(1\leq i\leq n\) satisfying
  \[
    f(\vect x+\vect h)
      -
    f(\vect x)

  \(f:U\to\mb R\) be a function, and let
  \(\vect p\in\mb R^n\setminus\{\vect 0\}\). Define the
  \textit{directional derivative} of \(f\) at \(\vect x\) in the direction
  \(\vect p\) by
  \[
    \frac{\partial f}{\partial \vect p}(\vect x)
      =
    \lim_{t\to 0}\frac{f(\vect x+t\vect p)-f(\vect x)}{t}

  Let \(\vect x\in U\subseteq\mb R^n\) where \(U\) is open, and let
  \(f:U\to\mb R\) be a function with first-order partial derivatives
  at \(\vect x\). Define its \textit{gradient} \(\nabla f(\vect x)\in\mb R^n\)
  at \(\vect x\) to satisfy \(p_i(\nabla f(\vect x))=f_{x_i}(\vect x)\)
  for all \(1\leq i\leq n\).
  If its gradient exists at every \(\vect x\in U\), then let
  \(\nabla f:U\to\mb R^n\) be the \textit{gradient function}
  defined by evaluating the gradient at each point.

  differentiable. Then for each \(\vect x\in U\) and
  \(\vect p\in\mb R^n\setminus\{\vect 0\}\), \(f\) has a directional derivative
  at \(\vect x\) in the direction of \(\vect p\) given by
  \[

\chapter*{Midterm Part 3}

Choose two of the below problems (which you did not choose for
Part 2) and typeset your solutions. Delete the other three.
Each will be worth 20/100 points towards your midterm grade
for a total of 40/100 points.


\begin{exercise}[1]
Prove that if \(Q_n\) is a partition of \([a,b]\) refining
the partition \(P_n\) of \([a,b]\) for each
natural number \(n\), and \(\{P_n\}\) is an Archimedian sequence of
partitions for \(f\) on \([a,b]\), then \(\{Q_n\}\) is also Archimedian.
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}

\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}[2]
Explain the error(s) in the following ``proof'',
and then give a counterexample showing that the theorem is false.

\textbf{Theorem:} If \(f:[0,1]\to\mathbb R\) is integrable, then
\(f\) is also continuous.

\textbf{Proof:}
Since \(f\) is integrable, we may define \(F:[0,1]\to\mathbb R\)
by \(F(x)=\int_0^x f\). It follows
that \(F(x)\) is a differentiable function, because it is an antiderivative
of \(f\). Thus \(\frac{d}{dx}[F(x)]=f(x)\) by the Second Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus. Since the derivative of any differentiable function
is continuous, we conclude \(f\) is continuous.
