\maketitle

This document is a template for you to take notes in my MATH 3142 course.
For your note check grade, you are required to complete all proofs/solutions
for the problems specified. This template will be updated periodically
throughout the course; you are responsible for updating your copy
as the template is updated. See the syllabus for more details.

You should maintain your notes on Overleaf.com and provide me with a
link so I can check on them. I'll give you notice before notes are ``due'';
when they are due I will download a copy myself from Overleaf.

This is not a replacement for the textbook for this course,
\textit{Advanced Calculus} by Patrick M. Fitzpatrick. Many proofs are
outlined in that text, as well as all the relevant definitions and other
results not included in these notes.

A proof is valid if and only if it uses concepts proven previously in
the book. For example, you cannot prove a lemma in Chapter 6 using
a theorem from Chapter 10, but using a proposition from Chapter 4
is allowed.

I hope you enjoy working through these results. Please email me with
any questions.

\section{Darboux Sums: Upper and Lower Integrals}

\begin{lemma}[6.1]
  Suppose that the function \(f:[a,b]\to\mb R\) is bounded and the numbers
  \(m,M\) have the property that
  \[
    m\leq f(x)\leq M
  \]
  for all \(x\) in \([a,b]\). Then, if \(P\) is a partition of the domain
  \([a,b]\),
  \[
    m(b-a)\leq L(f,P)
      \text{ and }
    U(f,P)\leq M(b-a)
  .\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}

\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}[6.2, The Refinement Lemma]
  Suppose that the function \(f:[a,b]\to\mb R\) is bounded and that \(P\)
  is a partition of its domain \([a,b]\). If \(P^\star\) is a refinement
  of \(P\), then
  \[
    L(f,P)\leq L(f,P^\star)
      \text{ and }
    U(f,P^\star)\leq U(f,P)
  .\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}

\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}[6.3]
  Suppose that the function \(f:[a,b]\to\mb R\) is bounded and that
  \(P_1,P_2\) are partitions of its domain. Then \(L(f,P_1)\leq U(f,P_2)\).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}

\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}[6.4]
  For a bounded function \(f:[a,b]\to\mb R\),
  \[
    \overline{\int_a^b} f
      \leq
    \underline{\int_a^b} f
  .\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}[2]
  For an interval \([a,b]\) and a positive number \(\delta\),
  show that there is a partition \(P=\{x_i:0\leq i\leq n\}\) of
  \([a,b]\) such that each partition interval \([x_i,x_{i+1}]\)
  of \(P\) has length less than \(\delta\).
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}

\end{solution}


\begin{exercise}[3]
  Suppose that the bounded function \(f:[a,b]\to\mb R\) has the property
  that for each rational number \(x\) in the interval \([a,b]\),
  \(f(x)=0\). Prove that
  \[
    \underline{\int_a^b}f
      \leq
    0
      \leq
    \overline{\int_a^b}f
  .\]
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}

\end{solution}


\begin{exercise}[6]
  Suppose that \(f:[a,b]\to\mb R\) is a bounded function for which there is
  a partition \(P\) of \([a,b]\) with \(L(f,P)=U(f,P)\). Prove that
  \(f:[a,b]\to\mb R\) is constant.
\end{exercise}
